* Initial Problem
The initial problem was identified when the `dig +short -6 google.com` command failed to resolve IPv6 addresses, indicating an issue with IPv6 DNS resolution. This required us to check and modify the DNS configuration.

* Verifying IPv6 Connectivity
To ensure the system had proper IPv6 connectivity, we used the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ping6 google.com
#+END_SRC

This confirmed that IPv6 connectivity was working correctly, as the command successfully pinged Google's IPv6 address.

* Editing resolved.conf
To troubleshoot `systemd-resolved` configuration, we checked and edited the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file to ensure it included the correct DNS server addresses:

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[Resolve]
DNS=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
#+END_SRC

After making the changes, we restarted the `systemd-resolved` service:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
#+END_SRC

* Bypassing systemd-resolved
To bypass `systemd-resolved` and directly configure DNS servers, we created a new `/etc/resolv.conf` file. This ensured DNS queries were sent directly to the specified DNS servers, bypassing any issues with `systemd-resolved`.

1. Backup the current `/etc/resolv.conf`:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup
#+END_SRC

2. Create a new `/etc/resolv.conf` with the following content:

#+BEGIN_SRC plaintext
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8888
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844
#+END_SRC

* Testing DNS Resolution
After configuring DNS servers manually, we tested DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dig google.com
dig +short -6 google.com
#+END_SRC

We also queried Google's DNS servers directly to verify the resolution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com
dig @2001:4860:4860::8888 google.com
dig @2001:4860:4860::8844 google.com
#+END_SRC

These tests confirmed that DNS resolution was working correctly for both IPv4 and IPv6.

* Final Verification and Summary
To ensure the changes were persistent and the system behaved correctly, we chose to keep the manual DNS configuration in `/etc/resolv.conf`. This approach ensured stable DNS resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Periodic verification can be done using the following commands:

1. Check `/etc/resolv.conf`:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat /etc/resolv.conf
#+END_SRC

2. Test DNS resolution:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dig google.com
dig +short -6 google.com
#+END_SRC

3. Direct queries to Google's DNS servers:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com
dig @2001:4860:4860::8888 google.com
dig @2001:4860:4860::8844 google.com
#+END_SRC

By following these steps, we successfully resolved the DNS resolution issues on the Fedora system. If any further issues arise, additional troubleshooting may be required.
